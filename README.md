# Photos_App

### Description

This project is a Flutter app currently being developed using the Dart language and the VS Code tool. It features two lists of items, with each item represented as a card displaying an image and the corresponding text. The project follows Clean Architecture and state management using Riverpod, which is a common approach for Flutter apps. It also incorporates design patterns such as Repository, Singleton, and Dependency Injection. As seen in the code, the architecture is divided into three layers: data, domain, and presentation. Additionally, there are two extra folders: "core," which contains the app's navigation system and route configuration, and "utils," which includes helper classes like constants.
